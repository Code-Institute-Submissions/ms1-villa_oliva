                <hr>
                <p>
                    ‘Villa Oliva’ is situated in a narrow, cobblestoned street on the island part of Tisno. The Forsek
                    family rediscovered this 18th century house in 2004. A lot of thought and heart was put into the
                    restoration of this property to make it look authentic, yet extremely comfortable. Although, only
                    the outer stone walls remain of the old house, the restoration preserved its original features. The
                    hidden treasure of the house is its secluded inner courtyard surrounded by stone walls which ensure
                    privacy and tranquillity.
                    The total surface area of the house is around 130 square metres spread over 3 floors. On the ground
                    floor, there is a large open living and dining area, small contemporary kitchen and a shower/toilet.
                    There is also a covered patio and an open terrace with a dining table and barbecue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the first floor, there are two bedrooms, one of which has a double bed and the other, two single
                    beds. In addition, there is a shared shower/toilet and a short corridor leading to a south oriented
                    smaller terrace. The terrace features a solar shower, deck chairs and parasol where you can enjoy
                    the sun throughout the day.
                    The third bedroom is situated in the attic, together with a small gallery accommodating an
                    additional single bed. The gallery can be used as a TV and play room, it is equipped with a lot of
                    books (English & Croatian language), board games and DVD movies. There is also a small balcony with
                    a view of the Karavaja hill and church tower.

                    Since the Forsek family spent almost 17 years living in the Middle East, you can find a slight touch
                    of the orient in the house furnishing and decoration. If you like, you can experience the oriental
                    atmosphere drinking tea and smoking argileh in the late afternoon.
                    Villa Oliva is a comfortable and intimate place for leisure, filled with plenty of light and sun.
                    Its position in the town centre allows easy access to shops, post office, exchange office, pharmacy,
                    doctor, cafes & restaurants etc.
                    It is equipped with all facilities required in the 3 star*** category such as wireless Internet, LCD
                    TV, air conditioning, dishwasher, washing machine, open grill for barbecue, outside shower,
                    deck-chairs, parasol, dining tables and chairs.
                    Considering the street is pedestrian zone only, parking is available on the squares at each end of
                    the street and costs around 20 EUR per week.
