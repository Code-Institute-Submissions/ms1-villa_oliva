                <p>
                    ‘Villa Oliva’ is situated in a narrow, cobblestoned street on the island part of Tisno. The Forsek
                    family rediscovered this 18th century house in 2004. A lot of thought and heart was put into the
                    restoration of this property to make it look authentic, yet extremely comfortable. Although, only
                    the outer stone walls remain of the old house, the restoration preserved its original features. The
                    hidden treasure of the house is its secluded inner courtyard surrounded by stone walls which ensure
                    privacy and tranquillity.
                    The total surface area of the house is around 130 square metres spread over 3 floors. On the ground
                    floor, there is a large open living and dining area, small contemporary kitchen and a shower/toilet.
                    There is also a covered patio and an open terrace with a dining table and barbecue.
